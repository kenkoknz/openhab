Install in windows7: Ken Kok (updated Jun18) 

Two ways to install either download files, extract and install zulu

or Install with Chocolatey (I have tries thiis method and it works)

Learnings: 

1. I had some problems with using cmd (admin) but using powershell(search powershell and right click as admin) seems to work ok following the instruction script

Right-click on the Start menu and select Command Prompt (admin) or Windows PowerShell (admin),
Install the Chocolatey package manager by running this command for powershell:
        Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
        
        

2. It was not clear where openhab was installed, however searching the console log, I found the path in :C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\openhab\tools 


3. to start use explorer (enable view hiddenfiles) and nav to directory and run the start.bat

4. go to a browse and enter local host:8080

3. Click standard install.

openHAB offers different UIs in its standard configuration: the Paper UI, 

the Basic UI and the Classic UI (this has to be installed manually from within Paper UI or via config file).
