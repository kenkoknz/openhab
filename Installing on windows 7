Install in windows7 (update Jun18)

two ways to install either download files, extract and install zulu

or Install with Chocolatey (I have tries thiis method and it works)

Learnings: 

1. had some problems with using cmd (admin) but using powershell(search powershell and right click as admin) seems to work ok

 Right-click on the Start menu and select Command Prompt (admin) or Windows PowerShell (admin)
    Install the Chocolatey package manager by running one of these commands:
        If you opened a command prompt (cmd.exe) 
        
        

2. It was not clear where openhab was installed, however searching the console log, I found the path in :C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\openhab\tools 


3. to start use explorer (enable view hiddenfiles) and nav to directory and run the start.bat

4. go to a browse and enter local host:8080

3. Click standard install.
